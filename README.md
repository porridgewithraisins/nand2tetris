# nand2tetris

An implementation of the projects described at https://www.nand2tetris.org.

The different folders correspond to different tasks outlined below:

-   Tasks 01 to 05: Implementing a complete CPU ISA with the primitive `NAND` gate and the primitive flip-flop. This was done in HDL.
-   Task 06: Building an assembler for that ISA.
-   Task 07: Designing a virtual machine, and it's bytecode interpreter
-   Task 09: Designing an OOP language, and writing a compiler that turns it into the VM's bytecode.
-   Task 12: Designing an operating system in this language.
-   Task 09: Writing a graphical Sudoku game for that operating system, in the designed language.

The computer facilitated screen and keyboard usage using memory-mapped I/O.
The assembler, interpreter and compiler were written in Typescript.
